Following tutorial "Pluralsight - Building a Web App with ASP NET 5, MVC 6, EF7, and AngularJS"

App is built on ASP.NET Core v. 1.0.1.
It uses local Environment variable AppSettings:BingKey(to launch it on your machine you should create this variable and set it's value as your private bing key).
Also it uses my private google.maps js api key which I've delated. You must put your key in the Trips.cshtml file in @section scripts src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key= line to make the map working.
